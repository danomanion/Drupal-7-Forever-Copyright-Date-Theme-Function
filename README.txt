Drupal 7 : Theme Copyright Date SET & FORGET! 

What Is This?
It's a theme function that will let you set the copyright date and never have to return to your website to change it when the new year comes. 

*Features*
- Custom Text
- Custom Seperator (between dates if diffrent)
- Copyright Date Set Eg. If the website was setup in 1981, use that date

Comments in code should help assist in setup.

The code in the 'template.tpl.php' is meant to be added to your theme's file of the same name.
The code in 'page.tpl.php' is an example of usage.
