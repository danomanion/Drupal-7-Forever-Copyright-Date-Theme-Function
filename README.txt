Drupal 7 : Forever Copyright Date

## What Is This?
It's a theme function that will let you set the copyright date and never have to return to your website to change it when the new year comes. 

## Features
- Custom Text
- Custom Seperator (between dates if diffrent)
- Copyright Date Set Eg. If the website was setup in 1981, use that date

Comments in code should help assist in setup.

- The code in the `template.tpl.php` is meant to be added to your theme's file of the same name.
- The code in `page.tpl.php` is an example of usage.
